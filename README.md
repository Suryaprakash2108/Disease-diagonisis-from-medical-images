# Lung and Colon Cancer Classification

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify medical images for **lung and colon cancer detection**. It leverages image preprocessing, data augmentation, and deep learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## 🧪 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled histopathological images of lung and colon tissues. It is organized into multiple classes (e.g., lung cancer, colon cancer, healthy tissues). The dataset should be structured in subfolders by class within the `train/`, `val/`, and `test/` directories.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- OpenCV & PIL
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or upload the notebook to Google Colab.
2. Ensure the dataset is uploaded in the correct structure.
3. Run each cell in sequence to train and evaluate the model.
4. Adjust the hyperparameters or model architecture for experimentation.

## 📊 Model Summary
The CNN model is trained to classify images into multiple classes using layers like:
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Dropout
- Dense (Softmax for multi-class classification)

Validation accuracy and loss graphs are also included for performance evaluation.

## 📈 Results
The model achieves high training and validation accuracy. Confusion matrix and classification report are included for deeper insights into class-wise performance.

## 📌 Note
- You can use GPU acceleration in Google Colab for faster training.
- Make sure the dataset paths are correctly set in the notebook before execution.

## 🧠 Future Work
- Model deployment as a Flask web app
- Integration with real-time medical diagnostic tools
- Transfer learning using pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
