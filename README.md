🧬 Lung and Colon Cancer Classification Using CNN – Deep Learning Project
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer tissues. It aims to assist early diagnosis by accurately distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using deep learning.

🔬 Built as part of an academic project by Mopada Surya Prakash, UG Scholar at Mohan Babu University, Tirupati, India.

🚀 Project Overview
🧪 Problem Statement: Diagnosing cancer through medical imaging can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project proposes a CNN-based approach to automate and improve the accuracy of cancer detection from histopathological images.

🧠 Solution: The model is trained on a labeled dataset of lung and colon tissue samples. It uses a deep CNN pipeline enhanced with transfer learning (InceptionResNetV2) to classify images with high precision.

📊 Use Case: Designed to support pathologists and researchers in medical diagnosis, research, and healthcare technology development.
