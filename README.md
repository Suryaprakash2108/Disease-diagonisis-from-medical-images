🧬 Lung and Colon Cancer Classification Using CNN – Deep Learning Project
This project uses deep learning to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer. Leveraging a powerful CNN architecture with InceptionResNetV2 as the backbone, it aims to automate cancer diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals with high accuracy.

🔬 Built as part of an academic project by Mopada Surya Prakash, UG Scholar at Mohan Babu University, Tirupati, India.

🧭 Project Overview
Problem Statement: Detecting cancer in tissue samples is challenging and time-consuming. Traditional manual diagnosis methods can be inconsistent.

Solution: This project uses CNNs to identify cancerous tissues in medical images. It implements transfer learning with InceptionResNetV2 and a custom classifier to distinguish between lung and colon cancer types.

Use Case: Useful for researchers, pathologists, and AI-based diagnostic systems to improve cancer detection accuracy and speed.
