# üß¨ **Lung and Colon Cancer Classification Using CNN ‚Äì Deep Learning Project**  

This project uses deep learning to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer. Leveraging a powerful CNN architecture with InceptionResNetV2 as the backbone, it aims to automate cancer diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals with high accuracy.

üî¨ Built as part of an academic project by Mopada Surya Prakash, UG Scholar at Mohan Babu University, Tirupati, India.

## üß≠ Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** Detecting cancer in tissue samples is challenging and time-consuming. Traditional manual diagnosis methods can be inconsistent.  

**Solution:** This project uses CNNs to identify cancerous tissues in medical images. It implements transfer learning with InceptionResNetV2 and a custom classifier to distinguish between lung and colon cancer types.  

**Use Case:** Useful for researchers, pathologists, and AI-based diagnostic systems to improve cancer detection accuracy and speed.
